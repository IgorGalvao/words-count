Word Count Challenge
 
This programming challenge should take around 1-3 hours, and can be done anytime prior to the interview.
 
The task is to create a user-facing form that counts the number of words in a block of text.
 
Acceptance Criteria:
 
As a user when I view the application then I see a form containing a text box to enter a body of text and when I submit the form with some text then I see a result containing the number of words in the text box
and when I submit the form with an empty text then I see a form error telling me that some text input is required.
 
As an engineer when I look at your project then I should understand how to install and run it.
 
The form can be delivered as a web page or mobile app. The word counting function(s) can be implemented in whatever language or framework you prefer.
 
You may use any third-party libraries or packages that you need to.
 
You may consult any resources that you use in your usual work: documentation, Stack Overflow, tutorials, etc. Using AI code generation tools (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Amazon CodeWhisperer) to solve the challenge is not permitted.

If there are limitations/known issues/todo's, comment them and be prepared to explain. 
 
This program will not be perfect and cover every edge case due to the time constraint. This exercise is as much about trade-offs as it is about code.
 
Feel free to make assumptions about the scope and requirements if not explicitly mentioned in the acceptance criteria. (In other words, just go for it!)
 
It should be a code that you are proud of and written in a professional manner.
 
Details for submission:
