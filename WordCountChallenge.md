Word Count Challenge
 
Acceptance Criteria:
  
As an engineer when I look at your project then I should understand how to install and run it.
 
This program will not be perfect and cover every edge case due to the time constraint. This exercise is as much about trade-offs as it is about code.
 
Feel free to make assumptions about the scope and requirements if not explicitly mentioned in the acceptance criteria. (In other words, just go for it!)
 
It should be a code that you are proud of and written in a professional manner.
 
Details for submission:
Please submit your solution in a public GitHub repository or google shared drive. Feel free to add whatever you need into the repository. Send us an email to hiring-eng@voxy.com when youâ€™re ready for Voxy to review the application.
